# hello-terraform
A terraform sample code collection. Can be used for study, or reference.

If you are terraform beginner, pull the code, follow the steps, then you will get the result.
I tried to make it tiny and workable.

We start from AWS, and will covery other mainstream clouds later.

## Prerequisite

1. You need to have a AWS account.
2. Create a IAM user for terraform practise.
3. (Optional) Install aws cli.
